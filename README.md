Future To-Do List:
1. Filter Tweets by Sport - Initially was not able to complete due to the twitter widget not refreshing, however, may be able to complete with changes to useScript or calling useScript again, will look into this later. 
2. Filter Scores by Sport - Again, not necessary for MVP, but figuring out the issue with filtering the tweets by sport would help solve this.
3. Explore using something other than scorestream. Significantly more complicated (and may not actually be possible), but would help make the app look a lot cleaner.
